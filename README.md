I could have done something simpler with this project, but I wanted to challenge myself a little bit. So I added the text-to-speech, copy to clipboard with an alert popup and the tweet button. When I was younger I used to think to myself how do developers do this and do that, and now with these projects, I can give those answers to myself by building from scratch different projects. The code was much simpler than I thought, and I gained a lot of confidence in myself when I saw how well everything worked out. 
Of course, I've had my share of bugs, but nothing a few researches wouldn't fix. :)
Also, I had a problem with the project because when I opened it locally, everything worked but trying to host it on github, the api wouldn't work because it gave me the mixed content error with the http/s. I had no idea about this problem, so even by hosting it I learned something new.
